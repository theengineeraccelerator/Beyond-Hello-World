SparkFun_Easy_Driver_Basic_Demo.ino - This is the test code for the Easy Driver I used to make sure that the hardware was connected up correctly

AccelStepper_Minimum.ino - This is the minimum amount of code that I found the could run the stepper reasonably. The setAcceleration and setMaxSpeed were required to get the motor to run at a resonable speed.

Bounce_BHWE.ino - This is adapted from one of the AccelStepper library examples to work with the setup that I had. 

Power Jack Adapter - These are the eagle files created to make the barrel jack to EasyDriver adapter board. The board was cut on an Othermill.
